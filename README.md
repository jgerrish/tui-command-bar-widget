# tui-command-bar-widget

This is a tui-rs widget for command bars or command lines.

It allows you to bind a key to focus or bring up the command bar,
enter in some text and then remove focus from the command bar.

The code is heavily based on the user_input and popup examples in the
tui-rs crate.  It abstracts the command line from that example into a
separate widget and provides some examples for use.

Thanks go to the authors of the tui-rs library for their amazing work.
